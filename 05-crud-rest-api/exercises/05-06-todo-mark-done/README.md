# TODO API for marking todo as done

## Objective:

Implement done for todo

## Exercises:

- Add new Postman request "Mark Todo as Done": PATCH with body `{ "isDone": true }`
- Update route to be able to PATCH update isDone
- Test Postman to see if it works.
- Check the result in "List Todo" if it works.

## Challenges:

- Why we use PATCH for marking as done, instead of PUT?
