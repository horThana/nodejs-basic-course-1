# Express.js Todo Website - Adding with new model

Implement the todo adding with the new model

## Exercise:

1. Update todo add to work with the new model.

   - The existing checking logic must remain the same.
   - Hint: We need to manually assign the ID to the new todo item.

2. Ensure that the ID won't be duplicate with existing todo IDs.

3. Add More optional field for todo description.

## Challenges:

1. Question: What is the proper ID to assign to the todo?
2. Return error if the description is longer than 50 characters.
3. Clean up all file read/write usages.
